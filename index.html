                            In the course Advanced Interaction Design, me and my team developed an Android app. I was the project leader and also responsible for the code implementation. The main goal for the application was to improve the training experience by utilizing multiple ways of interaction and create the best possible user experience. It resulted in a GPS-based map-view with training exercises. The design process was based on acknowledged design theory in addition to this, the prototypes developed were evaluated repeatedly through testing in an iterative process.

                            The project was developed in collaboration with two other students in the course Interaction Design, Basic Course. The task was to design a smart home device which would facilitate human needs. We developed a system called Tech.Care for elderly people to help them in their everyday life. Services such as medication reminders, help with personal hygiene, contact with healthcare providers and relatives. Tech.Care was supposed to be used in the bathroom on a touch screen mirror. During the project we made interviews, personas, created usability and user experience goals, performed bodystorming and tested both low- and high-fidelity prototypes.

                            The Rescue of Dataville is a learning game which I and my team have developed to improve knowledge about data literacy for children in ages ten to twelve. It was a collaboration between master engineer students and cognitive science master students. With the Swedish National Curriculum as a starting point, using theories in experience design, educational technology, and cognitive science, we created an educational game revolving around several mini-games, set in the fictional world of Dataville. I was the project leader and responsible for the development of the prototype and areas concerning interaction design. The project was performed during two courses: Interaction 1: Neuro Modelling, Cognitive Robotics and Agents and Interaction 2: Virtuality and Cognitive Modelling.

We developed a web page to get statistical information about moisture and water levels.

                            To improve the products to be more user-friendly I have developed a user-centered design process. It follows an iterative working approach and includes usability testing. I was also responsible for creating the usability testing plan. The goal was to improve the usability performance, by identifying positive and negative aspects of the product. The plan was based on my previous knowledge from the course Usability Evaluation.
